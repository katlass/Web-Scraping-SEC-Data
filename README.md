# Web-Scraping-SEC-Data
Web scraping commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit data from the SEC EDGAR public website https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/legacy/companysearch.html
I wrote some code to completely automate this process, so no RA time will be needed to perform manual search for each company's data.
The final output is an Excel spreadsheet that contains a tab for each quarter specified in the range in determining_files_topull.py for the top 15 largest holders of corporate commerical paper/negotiable certificates of deposit.
